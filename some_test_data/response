                content='It looks like you\'re trying to use the DeepSeek API to compare two numbers (9.11 and 9.8). However, there are a few issues with your code:\n\n1. You\'re missing an actual API key in `api_key=""` - you\'d need a valid key to use the service\n2. The `reasoning_content` attribute doesn\'t exist in the standard OpenAI API response format - this might be specific to DeepSeek\'s implementation\n3. The base URL points to DeepSeek\'s API, which may have different response formats than standard OpenAI\n\nHere\'s what a corrected version might look like (assuming DeepSeek\'s API follows similar patterns):\n\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI(api_key="your_api_key_here", base_url="https://api.deepseek.com")\n\nmessages = [{"role": "user", "content": "9.11 and 9.8, which is greater?"}]\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model="deepseek-reasoner",\n    messages=messages\n)\n\n# Try these instead if reasoning_content doesn\'t work\ncontent = response.choices[0].message.content\nprint("Response:", content)\n\n# Or check what attributes are actually available:\nprint("Available attributes:", dir(response.choices[0].message))\n```\n\nThe answer to your actual question (9.11 vs 9.8):\n- 9.8 is greater than 9.11 because when comparing decimals:\n  - The whole number part is equal (9 = 9)\n  - The tenths place (8) is greater than (1)\n  - So 9.8 > 9.11\n\nYou would need to consult DeepSeek\'s API documentation for the exact response format their API returns.',
